Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but can be "revived" for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.

            <li>It is a sport played on a court, which is divided into two halves.</li>
            <li>Each side has 7 players when the game starts. There will be 5 substitutes for each side as well. The games in Kabaddi are 40 minutes long.</li>
            <li>The two teams alternate between raiding and defending for two halves of twenty minutes each</li>
            <li>After halftime, the two teams switch sides of the court.</li>
            <li>The team with the most points at the end of the game (after 40 minutes) wins!</li>
            <li>The Lobby is the area of the court which is considered active only when contact has been made between the raider and a defender. Else, it is considered out of bounds for both raider and the defenders.</li>
            <li>Each side gets alternating turns to send any one player to the opponents side. This player is called the raider and each player on the opposing team is called a defender.</li>

            <li>The main objective of this game is to grab points by raiding into the opponent's court and touching as many opponent players as possible without getting caught on a single breath. Each player, chanting "Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi" enters into the opponent court and try to touch the defense players nearest to him, while the opponents make tactical coordinated efforts to catch that player.</li>
